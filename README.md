"Jog your memory with a simple fun game of Tic Tac Toe. No paper or partner needed. It is all digital face the computer to see if you’re up for the challenge.”

We would like to be able to utilize our learning of HTML/CSS with Python to build a game of Tic Tac Toe. The audience would vary,because it would be designed for anyone who has access to the Internet who simply wants to be reminded of a simple game that was played as a child.

We stumbled upon plenty of ideas but the use of Tic Tac Toe really stuck to us. We researched a lot of ideas on games. One idea that sought our attention was a fully automated Tic Tac Toe. The coding of Python was pretty lengthy and the user designed a great twist to the classic game. In which they used Java to fulfill these tasks. Others built a modeling example like the End of the course code in the python module to map out how they were going to begin coding. Some used Trinket to implement functions of an actual game board.

For the project it can be done solo but as we're gearing towards graduation majority of my classes are geared towards pushing people to work in pairs or with a group “to prepare you for the working world of depending on others” it really depends on the persons personality and how comfortable they’re. Some work better with others than by themselves and others work better in a group. We feel as if this should be a personal decision. Often times the idea of group work makes people nervous.
